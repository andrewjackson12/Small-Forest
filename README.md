Simple project to generate a forest using primitive objects in the three.js library.
To run, a local server must be set up for the directory so that the images can be accessed.

Implementations:
- Created a skydome using a SphereGeometry object. Loaded in an image using the TextureLoader to make the sky look more realistic.
- Implemented fog using the three.js Fog object
- Implemented ambient and directional light for the scene
- Implemented a function to create trees of random size within a range, as well as apply random positions and rotations to these trees to appear more natural.
